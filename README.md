Machine Learning Model to Predict Housing Prices
This project aimed to predict Housing Prices in Singapore by testing several machine learning models. The final model chosen was XGBoost, as it achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Project Highlights:
Data Processing: We split the dataset 70% training and 30% testing.
Models Used: Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and XGBoost.
XGBoost provided the best performance with an MSE of 188954614634
